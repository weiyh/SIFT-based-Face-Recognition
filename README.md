# SIFT-based Face Recognition

## Introduction
It's a final project of Computer Vision course.  
Our technology is based on this paper:  
	Luo, Jun, et al. "Person-specific SIFT features for face recognition." *Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 2007. ICASSP 2007. IEEE International Conference* on. Vol. 2. IEEE, 2007.  
  
  
## How it works
It's a Visual Studio Project. You can see the sample training and testing images in `../openCV/bin/Release/data/`, where 0.jpg is the testing data and 1.jpg-5.jpg are the training datas.  
The output of this program is showing which training image is most similar to the testing image.
